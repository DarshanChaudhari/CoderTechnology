			REVISION OF ANGULAR JS
=======================================================================================================================
For Angular 7
1) Node JS - How to install NodeJs - Site
2) Angular CLI - npm install @angular/cli -g

3) go to vs code
4) Create an angular projct using ng CLI commands
5) ng new myproject
6) to run the project npm start or ng serve
==> FOR BOOTSTRAP INSTALLATION
	npm install bootstrap@3 --save
AFTER INSTALLATION, COPY THE PATH OF CSS AND PLACE IT IN angular.json file in style:
"node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
7) To create an new Component - ng g c component/home
8) Main component is app-component.ts and main module is app-moduele.ts it is create by default
8) If you create a service at the decorator it will @Service


Steps in Angulars
1. Remove all app.component.html and remove just keep h1 tag
2. app.component.ts add value in title just like 'Angular Java Integration' in export class; 
3. For creating component ng g c components/home, It will create components folder inside that home folder
   and in home folder there are four files 
	-> In home.component.ts -> you will see

	@Component({
	selector: 'app-home',
	templateUrl: './home.component.html',
	styleUrls: ['./home.component.css']
})

Note : In Angular 4 app-routing.module folder create by-default

[4] ==> app-routing.module.ts
		For Creating Routes -- It is just mapping we have to create array of routes
			-> In app-routing.module.ts - > we are to create a routes
				const approutes: Routes =[
				{path:'home',component:HomeComponent},
				{path:'empList',component:HomeComponent},
				{path:'**',component:HomeComponent}
		
[5]==> Now create component of Emplist ng g c components/empList - Add in components folder 
	--> 
[6] Now to view Emplist html in localhost - app.component.htmls- add the routing module tags to view the  links

[7] - Now you have to create Services to provide http service.

[8]create Models - > To create Employee entity which have no command right create and create models/Employee.ts class

[9] Now in services folder -> empservice.service.ts file you have to use @Injectable 
	- For using injectable, here we have to use http service for this we have to use injectable in contructor.
	- Command - like this constructor(private http: HttpClient)
	- create a method getEmployeeList () {
	     in that you have to create --> get return this.http.get('http://localhost:8080/Spring_300_MVC_JPA_REST_Ng/hr/emps')
		}

[10] go back to component now we have to call that method we have put in empservice.servce.ts
[11] You have put HTTPClientModule in import app.module.ts 
[12] Now run it you will cors issue.
[13] Now implement the employee-list-service.component to view html

[14] do the ng build from the root project. Change the index.html <base href="./">
[15]  Copy the project dist folder and paste it on webcontent , restart the server and put .http://localhost:8080/Spring_300_MVC_JPA_REST_Ng/index.html
Note: Normally we have to create Module and in that module we have to place all this component, models, service routing folder must be there












=======================================================================================================================
==> For ANGULAR INSTALLATION

	npm  install @angular/cli -g  you can do it in cmd

==> CREATING THE ANGULAR PROJECT

	ng new myprojectname

==> OPEN IT IN VISUAL CODE
	got to src/app
	
	1. COMPONENT ==> ng g c home --->  ng = angular, g = generate, c= component, home directories
	2. SERVICES  ==> ng g s Employeedata ---> s = services
	3. INTERFACE ==> ng g i Employeedate ---> i = interface
	4. MODULES   ==> ng g m Employeedate ---> m = Module
	5. PIPES     ==> ng g p Employeedate ---> p = PIPES

==> TO START -- npm start or ng serve


==> FOR BOOTSTRAP INSTALLATION
	npm install bootstrap@3 --save
AFTER INSTALLATION, COPY THE PATH OF CSS AND PLACE IT IN angular.json file in style:
"node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"




==> FOR JSON INSTALLATION
	npm install -g json-server

==> TO START JSON SERVER
	json-server --watch db.json



==> NOTE: IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE PORT NUMBER : IN package.json -- add "start": "ng serve" --port 4500
