There are Server side and Client side
	Server side - DB, DAO,Businesss language , Service
	
	Client Side - Web Client  --> Sends WebPages --> Using -->Servlet JSP, Spring MVC, Struts, JSF
				- Application --> Sends Actual Data-->Using WebServices 1) SOAP 2)REST 3) AJAX --> it is explicitly for WebServer to Client
								 - csv, xml and json are pure text file, They are language free, it is just for transferring data.
				- Mobile Appl 
				- Machine

Loose-Coupling - Client side should not take care of whatever technology written in Server Side.				

CHALLENGES : - 
		1.  Exchange of Data in Common Format.
		2.  Intermediatory must be ubiqudious to platform of both sides.
		3.  Suppose in server side it is written in JAVA and client side it is fetching .Net so in Intermediatory
			it is receiving in one language and converting into another language. This is known aas Common Object
			Request Broking.
